assumptions :-
    - user will be uploading one image at a time
    - no error if user is entering wrong email for providing access
    - user or photos won't be deleted once created in database
    - photo access won't be revoked once access is provided to a user
    - user will be able to access the photo if the user have image url with him/her

database :-
    users
        id              :   ID
        name            :   String
        email           :   String
        image           :   String
        password        :   String
        photos          :   photoID[]

    photos
        id              :   ID
        url             :   String
        user            :   userID

points considered for designing database :-
    - will store photos id as a foreign key in user table 
        - will help in fetching images for a particular user fast (search operations will be less in photo table)

routes :-
    /auth
        POST /login
    /users
        POST /users
        PATCH /users
        GET /users/me
    /photos
        GET /photos
        POST /photos
        PATCH /photos/:id


controllers :-
    auth
        login

    user
        createUser
        getUser
        updateUser

    photo
        fetchPhotos
        uploadPhoto
        updatePhoto


services :-
    auth
        login

    user
        createUser
        getUser
        updateUser
        givePhotoAccess

    photo
        fetchPhotos
        uploadPhoto
        updatePhoto


middlewares :-
    auth
        authenticateUser


utils :-
    jwt
        createJWTToken
        verifyJWTToken
    hashing
        hashPassword
        verifyPassword


points for improvement :-
    - indexing could be implemented on email field of user and id field of photos table
    - email could be used instead of id while fetching the user from database as the email is also going to be unique
    - architechture could be improved like instead of accessing the user repository in photos service, we could call 
        a function of user service
    - test cases could be improved according to the validation added
